<h1>This Repository is all about Practicing Baiscal Python Programming / Scriping Language Practically üìëüßëüèª‚Äçüíªüñ•Ô∏è</h1>

- Firstly we will start with basic of Big O Notation and followed by Time Complexity to execute the code with practical examples.

- Here is the Roadmap for Practicing Basic Python Programming in 2025

- After Introduction to Big O Notation and Time Complexity, we will be learning the basic syntax of Python.

- Then we will try to reduce the time complexity of the code execution with the help of thread.

- We will learn about what is variable and how variables are defined in Python Programming / Scriping Language.

- When we are able to define variables correctly, we will go through Basic Datatypes in Python.

- After learning Datatypes, we will learn about Looping Statements in Python.

- Then we will be jumping into Python Operatos with their practical examples.

- After Operators we will be learning about Functions in Python with their practical examples.
